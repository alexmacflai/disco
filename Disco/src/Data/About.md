# Disco

Disco is a satire app about the emotional ergonomics of being constantly reachable.

You press a button to “disconnect”. The app doesn’t celebrate. It monitors.

It sends notifications at random intervals that escalate over time. Not angry. Just… increasingly invested in your attention.

## Why it exists

Modern connection is sold as freedom.

In practice it often becomes:

- a low-level obligation
- a background buzz
- a reflex to check
- a tiny fear of missing something that was never that important

Disco plays that back to you. Like a mirror with a corporate lanyard.

## What happens in Disco

During disconnect mode:

- A timer counts how long you’ve been away.
- Notifications try to reach you.
- If iOS suppresses a notification, Disco still logs it as **attempted**.
- The app acknowledges misses: “We tried to reach you.”

Inside the app:

- You can open the Notification Center and see what was received vs attempted.
- You can mark items as read one by one.
- The unread count may lag a little.

When you end disconnect mode:

- You get a hollow, corporate-style praise screen.
- You see your total disconnect duration.
- The experience should feel like relief mixed with failure, not success.

## The point

Disco isn’t trying to help you “win”.

It’s asking a more annoying question:

**If you disconnect and still don’t feel better… what were you actually looking for?**

Relief is real.

So is the urge to go back.

## Notes

- iOS may throttle or suppress notifications. That’s normal.
- Disco treats suppression as part of the story.
- Auto-locking your phone is not possible from an app. Lock it manually.
